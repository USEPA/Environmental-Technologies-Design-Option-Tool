C  IMSL Name:  M1VE
C
C  Computer:   pcdsms/SINGLE
C
C  Revised:    March 5, 1984
C
C  Purpose:    Move a subset of one character array to another.
C
C  Usage:      CALL M1VE(INSTR, INBEG, INEND, INLEN, OUTSTR, OUTBEG,
C                         OUTEND, OUTLEN, IER)
C
C  Arguments:
C     INSTR  - Source character array.  (Input)
C     INBEG  - First element of INSTR to be moved.  (Input)
C     INEND  - Last element of INSTR to be moved.  (Input)
C              The source subset is INSTR(INBEG),...,INSTR(INEND).
C     INLEN  - Length of INSTR.  (Input)
C     OUTSTR - Destination character array.  (Output)
C     IUTBEG - First element of OUTSTR destination.  (Input)
C     IUTEND - Last element of OUTSTR  destination.  (Input)
C              The destination subset is OUTSRT(IUTBEG),...,
C              OUTSTR(IUTEND).
C     IUTLEN - Length of OUTSTR.  (Input)
C     IER    - Completion code.  (Output)
C              IER = -2  indicates that the input parameters, INBEG,
C                        INEND, INLEN, IUTBEG, IUTEND are not
C                        consistent.  One of the conditions
C                        INBEG.GT.0, INEND.GE.INBEG, INLEN.GE.INEND,
C                        IUTBEG.GT.0, or IUTEND.GE.IUTBEG is not
C                        satisfied.
C              IER = -1  indicates that the length of OUTSTR is
C                        insufficient to hold the subset of INSTR.
C                        That is, IUTLEN is less than IUTEND.
C              IER =  0  indicates normal completion
C              IER >  0  indicates that the specified subset of OUTSTR,
C                        OUTSTR(IUTBEG),...,OUTSTR(IUTEND) is not long
C                        enough to hold the subset INSTR(INBEG),...,
C                        INSTR(INEND) of INSTR.  IER is set to the
C                        number of characters that were not moved.
C
C  Remarks:
C  1. If the subset of OUTSTR is longer than the subset of INSTR,
C     trailing blanks are moved to OUTSTR.
C  2. If the subset of INSTR is longer than the subset of OUTSTR,
C     the shorter subset is moved to OUTSTR and IER is set to the number
C     of characters that were not moved to OUTSTR.
C  3. If the length of OUTSTR is insufficient to hold the subset,
C     IER is set to -2 and nothing is moved.
